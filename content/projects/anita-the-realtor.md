  theclient: >-
    Being licensed since April of 2009 and a Certified Probate Real Estate
    Specialist, Anita can provide you a wealth of knowledge in the area. Her
    extensive background in real estate allows her to understand my clients’
    needs and far exceed their expectations. She work with plenty of first time
    home buyers and investors who describe her as an experienced and trustworthy
    professional.
  thechallenge: >-
    Anitas previous website designer had retired and she was in need of help
    with migrating the site to a new host and developer. She found me through
    Google and quickly got in touch.
  theapproach: >-
    The site she needed was more hands off so she can focus on her real estate
    business. I integrated IDX to the website for search capabilities and lead
    capture tools. All the forms on the website converted leads into a CRM where
    they can be managed.

    Super easy to work with! His timeline is excellent. He recently designed my
    website: www.AnitaTheRealtor.com. I’m looking for some simplicity and he
    delivered it.

    After the launch, I monitored the website for a month for performance. The
    site was built on Wordpress for flexibility in future cases where features
    may need to be added.

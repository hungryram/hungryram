    Yoori Park is a Los Angeles Realtor partnering with Hungry Ram for a luxury
    real estate website design
overview:
  theclient: >-
    Throughout her career, Yoori Park has been consistently recognized for
    various awards. At a national bank, she quickly became the top teller in the
    district and second in the region. Her clients appreciated her no-nonsense
    approach as she tailored her recommendations unique to the individual and/or
    entity. Many years and career fields later, Yoori tried the luxury auto
    industry and once again was among the top three salespersons just within the
    first year and continued to remain among the top five. Her top scores,
    ratings, and reviews can all attest to her success, which she attributes to
    her own expertise and genuine care.
  thechallenge: >-
    Yoori needed to work with someone who was always available for updates on
    the website while she focuses on the real estate business. I was able to
    ensure her that any updates she needed will be completed on time.
  theapproach: >-
    Real estate website needed a few key features such as listing property
    details and making it user friendly for visitors. On the back-end side,
    Yoori can easily set listings to either exclusive or sold as well as
    checking on listing data views.
  projectreview: >-

    up on my website.

    ## Static websites are now back in!


    With popular CMS like Wordpress and Squarespace growing, one thing they
    can't compete with a static website is performance. No matter what articles
    claim that Wordpress can achieve a high performing or high page speed, it
    doesn't top static.


    Yes, Wordpress is still being used by Hungry Ram for certain clients
    requesting some features but since shifting the business goal to stand out
    from our competitors, static sites are the primary focus.


    ## When to use Wordpress


    Wordpress can be too heavy and cause a lot of bloat that can impact your
    page speed score on Google. Sometimes the need of Wordpress relies on more
    complicated websites like IDX powered real estate sites that requires search
    capabilities.


    ## When to use Static Sites


    Based off of information or features a website needs, I will determine if a
    static site would be the best to move forward with. A basic info site can
    definitely be converted to a static website to achieve a higher score on
    page speed.


    Although static sites do take longer to build, it definitely is worth the
    time and investment when seeing it's high performance.
